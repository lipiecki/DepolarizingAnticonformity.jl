# Depolarizing Power of Anticonformity
`DepolarizingAnticonformity.jl` is a replication package for the paper A. Lipiecki, K. Weron, Depolarizing Power of Anticonformity (2024).

## Installation
To install the package, use the following lines in Julia REPL:
```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/lipiecki/DepolarizingAnticonformity.jl")
```
there is no need to download the repository manually, you can install it directly to your Julia environment.

## Numerical evolution of the system
Performing the evolution of the dynamical systems corresponding to different model specifications is done by a single function call. `runstudy(q::Int, Q::Int, type::Symbol)` performs the the entire study for specified `q` and `Q` (as described in the paper) and model specification `type`, which can take one of the following values:
- `type=:dynamic1` for Conformity with BC and Anticonformity in the Dynamic (Annealed) approach
- `type=:dynamic2` for Conformity without BC and Anticonformity in the Dynamic (Annealed) approach
- `type=:dynamic3` for Conformity with and without BC in the Dynamic (Annealed) approach
- `type=:static1` for Conformity with BC and Anticonformity in the Static (Quenched) approach
- `type=:static2` for Conformity without BC and Anticonformity in the Static (Quenched) approach
- `type=:static3` for Conformity with and without BC in the Static (Quenched) approach.

The function prints the summary of phase classification and saves the output file in `DepolarizingAnticonformityResults/OutputFiles` (the directory is automatically created if it does not exists). The file is in the .jld2 format, and stores the data as a dictionary with the following key:value pairs:
- `intervention_strength`: the vector of values describing the strength of intervention (`0.01:0.0005:0.5` by default)
- `probability_outgroup`: the vector of values describing the probability of outgroup interaction (`0.01:0.0005:0.5` by default)
- `polarization_index`: the matrix of polarization index values, where the first index corresponds to the intervention strength, and the second to probability of outgroup interaction
- `opinion_concentration`: the three-dimensional array of stationary opinion concentrations, where the first index corresponds to the intervention strength, the second to probability of outgroup interaction and the third specifies agent types: 
    - `1` for agents in faction `A` holding opinion `-1`
    - `2` for agents in faction `A` holding opinion `1`
    - `3` for agents in faction `B` holding opinion `-1`
    - `4` for agents in faction `B` holding opinion `1`
- `phase`: the matrix identifying the phase, where the first index corresponds to the intervention strength, and the second to probability of outgroup interaction. The phases are denoted using the following notation: 
    - `2` for In-Group Polarization
    - `1` for Between-Group Polarization
    - `-1` for Pole Consensus
    - `-2` for Middle-Ground Consensus
    - `0` if the phase has not been classified

Below you can find an example of how to run a single study:
```julia
using DepolarizingAnticonformity # loads the package
q = 3
Q = 4
type = :dynamic1
runstudy(q, Q, type)
#=
q=3, Q=4, type=dynamic1, Î”=0.0

## Plots
In order to generate a polarization map from the results stored in `DepolarizingAnticonformityResults/OutputFiles`, use `polarizationmap(q, Q, type)`:
```julia
polarizationmap(3, 4, :dynamic1)
```
and to generate a phase map for the same results, call `phasemap(q, Q, type)`:
```julia
phasemap(3, 4, :dynamic1)
```
the figures are saved in `DepolarizingAnticonformityResults/Figures` (the directory is automatically created if it does not exists).

## Sensitivity analysis
In addition to the code replicating the results presented in the paper, `DepolarizingAnticonformity.jl` provides the tool for sensitivity analysis. It runs the numerical evolution of systems with shifted initial conditions and compares the phase classification against the unperturbed system. The method checks the perturbations of initial conditions in the form of:
$$c_{0B}(0) = \varepsilon + \Delta, \quad c_{1B}(0) = \frac{1}{2} - \varepsilon - \Delta,$$
where $\Delta\in$ { $10^{-5}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-2}, 10^{-1}$ } and $\varepsilon = 10^{-6}$ is introduced to avoid instabilities in systems that exhibit symmetry breaking. The method creates a plot which colors the phase space by the $-\log_{10}(\Delta)$ required to introduce change: the darker the color, the higher the sensitivity of phase classification to the inital conditions.

To run the sensitivity analysis, call `sensitivitymap(q, Q, type)`:
```julia
sensitivitymap(3, 4, :dynamic1)
```
this will print the classification summary and save the sensitivity plot as well as the .jld2 file allowing to replicate the plot.

## Notes
For convenience, the notation for opinion values used in the source code differes from the one in the paper. In the implementation, different values of the three-state ranked opinion are denoted by 1, 2 and 3.

The following execution times were obtained (measured on the Apple M2 Pro chip):
- `runstudy(2, 2, :dynamic1)` ~ 90 seconds
- `runstudy(3, 4, :dynamic1)` ~ 115 seconds
- `runstudy(2, 2, :static1)` ~ 150 seconds
- `runstudy(3, 4, :static1)` ~ 200 seconds
- `senistivitymap(q, Q, type)` can take up to 30 minutes for a single set of arguments
